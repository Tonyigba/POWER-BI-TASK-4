# POWER-BI-TASK-4

# Introduction:

The ability to derive meaningful insights from data is paramount. This is where Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions in Power BI come into play.

The DAX functions serve as powerful tools in Power BI for performing calculations and aggregations and they help to derive meaningful insights and metrics from the dataset.

These DAX functions are used to gain deeper insights, perform advanced analyses, and create customized measures and columns that suit specific business needs. DAX functions provide the flexibility and functionality necessary for robust data modeling and reporting in Power BI.

Problem Statement:
1. Create a measure for the ‘Average age of depositors’
2. Create a new column named ‘Age band’ containing the following:
  ‘Young’ for ages below 30
  ‘Mid Aged’ for ages between 30 and 50
  ‘Old’ for ages above 50
3. Create a measure calculating the total balance for:
  Job: Technician
  Marital: Single and married
4. Create a measure to get the number of depositors on loan
